# How It Works:

## Card Movement:

Users can drag and drop cards from one swimlane to another to update the status of tasks.
The app automatically updates the database with the new status of the task.

## Priority Adjustment:

Users can rearrange cards within the same swimlane by dragging them to different positions.
The app updates the priority of the cards in the database based on their new positions.
If the user moves a card to a higher position, the priorities of other cards in that swimlane might be adjusted to maintain a sequential order.

The app ensures that the position and order of cards are stored in the database.
Even after a page refresh, the app retrieves and displays cards in the exact same order as before.
Usage:

## Moving Cards:

Adjusting Priority:

To change the priority of cards within a swimlane, drag and drop cards to different positions.
The cards will automatically adjust their priority based on their new positions.
Page Refresh:
